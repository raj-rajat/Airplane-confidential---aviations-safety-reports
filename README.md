# Aviation Safety Reports Analysis ‚úàÔ∏è

## Dataset Description üìä

The dataset contains aviation safety reports collected by NASA from pilots, technicians, flight attendants, and other personnel. It includes text narratives, as well as details about flight conditions and other safety factors.

## Analysis Attempted üîç

1. **Number of Reports per Year**: Analyzed the number of reports submitted each year.
2. **Most Common Words in Text Narratives**: Analyzed the most common words in the text narratives of the reports.
3. **Text Length Distribution**: Analyzed the distribution of the length of the text narratives.
4. **Most Common Contributing Factors / Situations**: Analyzed the most common contributing factors or situations mentioned in the reports.
5. **Most Common Aircraft Operators**: Analyzed the most common aircraft operators mentioned in the reports.
6. **Most Common Flight Phases**: Analyzed the most common flight phases mentioned in the reports.
7. **Most Common Reporter Organizations**: Analyzed the most common reporter organizations mentioned in the reports.
8. **Most Common Aircraft Makes and Models**: Analyzed the most common aircraft makes and models mentioned in the reports.
9. **Most Common Events**: Analyzed the most common events mentioned in the reports.
10. **Most Common Locations**: Analyzed the most common locations mentioned in the reports.

## Challenges Encountered üöß

The dataset is very large, and it was not possible to process the entire dataset in its entirety due to memory limitations. Instead, a subset of the data was analyzed, and the results may not be fully representative of the entire dataset.

## Recommendations for Further Analysis üí°

1. Use a more powerful computing environment or a cloud computing service to analyze the entire dataset and create more representative visualizations.
2. Perform topic modeling to identify common themes in the text narratives.
3. Perform sentiment analysis to determine the sentiment of the reports.
4. Perform time series analysis to identify any trends or patterns in the number of reports over time.
5. Perform geospatial analysis to identify any geographic patterns or trends in the locations mentioned in the reports.
